## About this Project
- **Live website:** <https://cenolab.netlify.app/>
- **Server API repository:** <https://github.com/muhhx/Cenolab-Backend>
  
The client is an architecture company focused on events and festivals. They wanted a website with an "fun" identity and with their branding.

The goal of the web application was to make a institutional, as well as a portfolio website with an admin panel, so the admin could create, delete and edit their architecture projects.

Besides the CRUD operations, the app also contains User Authentication with JWT and a mailing service to people get in contact.
